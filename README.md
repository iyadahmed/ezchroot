# ezchroot
A simple script for creating a chroot

example: `./ezchroot.sh new_chroot`  
will create a chroot tree in the current directory under new_chroot directory, it will also start bash

Ideas: add git and make and make them work, allow user to customize via cli options, etc...

contribution is very welcome :star:
